										<p>Vietnam used to have a nutrient rich environment that was capable of supporting thousands of unique species of plants and animals. In the late 1950’s, the environment was severely damaged due to the side-effects of the fighting tactics the northern and southern Vietnamese used in war. The impacts of these events left the environment a wasteland and destroyed vital aspects of the ecosystem that the locals needed to thrive. In this paper, I will discuss how the animals and croplands were effected through anthropogenic war-induced activities and the steps that should be taken to prevent another ecological travesty.</p>
										<p>Since the signing of the Geneva contract in 1954, Vietnam was separated into two distinct boundaries, a northern and southern half (Staff, 2008). The southern half of Vietnam ruled itself as a capitalist nation while the northern half was led under a communist ruling. In 1959, the northern communist regime under the direction of Ho Chi Minh commenced guerilla warfare in southern Vietnam. To preserve their style of living, the south retaliated. After a few years, each side of the war was backed by different world superpowers who wanted an input on how Vietnam was going to be ruled. This led to the decision from the United States to stand behind the southerner’s views while the Soviet Union supported the northerner's views.
</p>
										<p>In the peak of the war between 1959 and 1965, both northern and southern Vietnamese forces incorporated extreme military procedures that had nearly irreversible effects on the ecosystem around it. To this day, the land where the battles took place are still uninhabitable and the ecosystem will take thousands of years to return to its previous nutrient rich state (Kieran, 2015). Although the Vietnamese may not have been fully aware of the effects of these harmful tactics, they surely knew that it could lead to future issues.</p>
										<p>Much of the damage done to the environment from the Vietnam war pertains towards the use of napalm and scorching military practices. In both tactics, the land is burned to remove the vegetation that the soldiers are using as cover in battle. Arial napalm strikes are called in and delivered from planes that drop a napalm, which is a combination of a mixture of a gelling agent and gasoline. (Agoston et al., 1954). The fire starts by burning from the top down, causing the emergent layer to burn first then spread down to the forest floor. In the process of burning, the fire stops for nothing. It destroys all living organisms’ homes in the ecosystem and kills most animals dwelling in the area. Scorched earth techniques are similar in the sense of environmental damage caused by it, however, ground troops do it instead of planes. Scorched earth methods are used when retreating from a foreign territory to both destroy the protection that tall grass and trees give soldiers, and to annihilate enemy crop lands from being used again to produce food.</p>
										<p>Effects of scorched earth and napalm techniques include the decrease in biodiversity of the vegetation as well as the native wildlife in the ecosystem. Simply put, with less biodiversity, a population is more susceptible to extinction due to its inability to adapt to future complications (Orians, 1970). If one type of animal or plant is removed from an ecosystem that depends on it, often the entire food chain is thrown off and the ecosystem slowly crumbles on top of itself. Also, the burning of the agriculture can destroy ecosystem services that the environment provides for the people that live in and around it. For example, many of the crops grown in the area were used to feed the local population. The excess food could be sold or traded away to other countries. The environment also provided essential marketable goods consisting of raw materials such as lumber and organic matter. Also, many medicines were derived from plants found in local territories. The trees helped to convert carbon dioxide in the air into oxygen and they helped to purify water by limiting runoff.</p>
										<p>Other war strategies such as pesticide use in the form of agent orange were also introduced at the time of the Vietnam war. Agent orange is an herbicide that is composed of dioxin which is used to rapidly kill vegetation(Silverman, 2008). In the war, nearly 11 million gallons of agent orange was deployed onto Vietnam’s land. The reasoning behind the deployment of agent orange is like that of the scorched earth and napalm usage; to destroy crops and hiding places. Other than the loss of agriculture and the effects of that which were previously explained, agent orange has been linked to many health-related issues with local Vietnamese citizens and Vietnam veterans (Silverman, 2008). Dioxin is now known as a human carcinogen which can damage essential bodily functions such as the endocrine, immune, or the nervous system. If small doses of this carcinogen are found in your body, you have a much greater chance of contracting cancer or other deadly diseases. In addition, Pregnant mothers with dioxin in their bodies often give birth to defected children (Galston, 1972).</p>
										<p>The long-term impacts of pesticides and extreme burning of soil in an ecosystem are a lot more severe than once believed. Scorched soil can take millennia to replenish all the minerals it has lost. This leads to infertile crop lands which will force farmers out of the area. Without farmers, much of the food will need to be imported from lands far away which can be pricey. Essentially, it would be more practical to move to healthier land than to continue living in the same places. Pesticides can also be spread to birds and other very mobile creatures who can carry new diseases that they recently contracted to new areas (Minarik et al., 1968). This will introduce a new plague in animals that could eventually pass on to humans. The swine flu is a recent example of this phenomena. Finally, pesticides will essentially decrease the total property value of the land for future generations since the trees and ecosystem services will be out of balance for many years to follow.
</p>
										<p>Currently, there are a very limited amount of environmental policies in place that regulate the intensity of fighting tactics. One of the few rulings that are currently in place derived from the amended protocols of the Geneva Convention. Many of these amendments prohibit actions that will cause or may be expected to cause, environmental damage that is severe, widespread, and long-lasting (Bothe, 2007). Since it is challenging to put an exact definition to this amendment, The United Nations (UN) are tasked with completing the ruling behind which acts go against the Geneva agreement. Problems such as the lack of research behind the extreme pesticide usages or scorched earth techniques complicate the UN’s ability to determine what is truly against the contract (Krishnamurthy, 2014).</p>
										<p>Generalities in the Geneva agreement provide room for a gray area where nations can still use their abusive techniques and not be punished by them. This stems to a new issue; the lack of time which the UN has to be able to deny a recently discovered tactic. Since war is continually evolving, new methods of fighting are seen in every war that is fought. Whether it is the addition of agent orange or napalm strikes, the UN had little to no research on the long-term effects of these devices. Having a lack of time, research, and specificity all prevent the Geneva agreement from being successfully enforced. Along with each of these previously stated factors, the agreement fails to acknowledge border aspects or physical boundaries such as the geodiversity of the war zone (Galston, 1972). If a small yet significant part of the ecosystem is crucial to the health of the entire environment, a war in that area should be prohibited.</p>
										<p>The limiting factor in figuring out the true solution to environmental war regulations come from the application of the laws. The punishment for abusing the already established rules are usually in the form of a fine. However, in many accounts, the nation that is being fined is undergoing an economic trough; leading them to be in a debt that is already nearly impossible to rebound from. Nations may not be able to pay the money that the UN is demanding from them leading to more complications. If they do not pay the tax, what punishments are set in place for them? The current ruling set in stone from the Geneva convention is that “The following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place, whatsoever”. The punishment for ignoring the additional protocols are not clearly stated and have yet to be enforced.</p>
										<p>There are some solutions to help reduce the impact of war on the environment which includes the increase in specificity of already set rules or to develop peace agreements. Although it would be beneficial to clarify the boundaries in terms of military battle methods, no matter how lengthy or deep the regulation is altered, there will always be a gray area. In addition, the punishment of not following through with the regulations would need to be established in a way that allows the nation to rebuild its economy and at the same time allocate funds towards the recuperation of their environment.</p>
										<p>Peace agreements seem like an easy solution to many of the world’s problems until they are broken. In times of war, nations take drastic measures to ensure they obtain their wanted outcome. Often, peace treaties will be broken; take the treaty of Versailles as an example. After World War 1, Germany agreed to limit their military size. Five years later, Hitler decided that he wanted to move his troops into a demilitarized area, ultimately breaking all rules that were previously set. As expected, this angered many nations and eventually was a contributing factor to an even worse conflict: World War II.</p>
										<p>The most effective method to regulate the environmental damage caused by war activities would be the creation of an entirely new agreement. In this agreement, a predetermined amount of money would be taxed from each nation annually based on the nation's GDP that would be set aside towards the rehabilitation of toxic environments. This tactic would not only be reasonable and affordable, but it would also be effective. As mentioned earlier, one of the larger issues with the Geneva protocols was forcing nations to pay for ecosystem repairs after the war. If every nation put in a small amount of money each year, it would help to fund much of the cost. In the 2015 Paris peace conferences, nations across the world agreed that the environment is worth putting effort into saving. Each nation devised their own objectives on what they can improve and how fast it is needed to be done. It is not unreasonable whatsoever to implement a tax that would help to extend their beliefs into one of the most environmentally concerning issues today: war.
										</p>

										<p>Another problem that was addressed against the productivity of the Geneva convention is how are the new rules going to be enforced. The problem with the Geneva conferences dictation is that they attempted to tax nations that are already in debt causing a hardship for them. In the new method that is proposed above, nations will be making their payments when they have enough money to afford it. The chances that problems will arise when collecting funds are much less likely when a nation agrees to pay a tax rather than it being forced upon them.</p>
										<p>The last issue that the Geneva principles failed to cover is the punishment for abiding by the principles agreed on in the amendments. Although there is no simple solution to this problem, the implementation of the new ruling would also establish that nations who fails to meet the required tax will have higher tariffs on foreign goods. This policy will ensure that one way or another, there will be funding for the cleaning of our environment in a safe and efficient manner. With these factors considered, our environments will be cleaner, safer, and less susceptible to extreme militaristic damage. Not only does the addition of this new law allow the world to have a system where predetermined regulations and punishments are set, but it also promotes a unifying of nations to join against a common enemy: climate change.</p>
										<p>Future conflicts in Vietnam excluding those events described above never hit the lever of severity that has previously has been seen. Since then, no changes in Vietnam’s post-war policy have been mandated.  In addition, no large national charges have been created despite many opportunities such as the 2016 Paris Peace Conference.  The only progress that has been made is in 1976, the Environmental Modification Techniques treaty was signed (Red Cross, 1977). This treaty prevents the use of all-weather weapons that can create severe environmental damage. Although this is a step in the right direction, it is not enough to prevent the destruction of our ecosystem such as seen in Vietnam in the mid-1900’s. The agent orange used during the war damaged the crop lands and have prevented farmers from using the soil for decades and many more years to come. Essentially, all the damaged land limits the population growth in Vietnam due to a lack of space to grow food. With the addition of the tax law mentioned earlier, the environmental issues caused by the pesticides, napalm, and the scorched earth policy could’ve been lessened significantly.</p>
										<p>Due to Vietnam’s large rates of unemployment and poverty, they have had trouble supplying money for the upkeep of their environment. This is an issue that could be fixed through annual taxing since each nation would be forced to provide aid for something everyone is forced to care about: the environment.
Wars that took place after the 1976 Environmental Modification Techniques agreement have yet to see as large use of pesticides as was used in Vietnam. However, the scorched earth made its return in 1991 in the Gulf War (Liden, 2004). In addition, oil spills seen in the Gulf War have caused an immense amount of problems the world has yet to experience. Defects in children and immune system cancer are just a few of these impacts on humans; the secondary consumers of this water. The primary users of the body of water either died to suffocation in the thick oils or had similar birth defect as seen in humans (NOAA, 2016).</p>
										<p>Ultimately, with limits set and laws in place, the biodiversity and health of ecosystems during a war in all nations will drastically increase. Overall, most aspects of sustainability will increase at the cost of a reasonable tax. Not only does this plan help to fill in the gaps of the previously made Geneva principles, but it also will help to prevent future conflicts.</p>
